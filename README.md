# About
MojangFetcher is an open source project made by the LiquifyMC group, owning and sharing Project Plus.
The Mojang fetcher allows developers to fetch any sustained user that has ever had a UUID confronted in Mojang's Backend Authentication.
### How it works?
Our Mojang fetcher has 3 services connected to it currently, although if you have any more services you want to include
you can add one by extending one of our structured interfaces.
